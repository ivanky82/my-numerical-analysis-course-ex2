# my-numerical-analysis-course-ex2
created a matlab/octave code for Lab 2 of my numerical analysis course. This is still in Indonesian language.
The file ex2.m is the main file that contains information to do this matlab/octave exercise. 
This exercise is about how to find roots of one-dimensional non-linear equations using bisection methods.
